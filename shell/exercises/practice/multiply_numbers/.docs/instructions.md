Write a Shell function `multiply_numbers() {` to solve the following problem: Calculates the product of two positive integers A and B.
 Given two positive integers, this function computes their product.
 It is important to consider the range of the result to ensure that it does not exceed shell arithmetic limits.
 Args:
 A (int): The first positive integer.
 B (int): The second positive integer.

 Output:
 Prints the product of A and B.

 Examples:
 >>> multiply_numbers 5 10
 50
 >>> multiply_numbers 123 456
