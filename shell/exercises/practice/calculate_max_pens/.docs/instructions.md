Write a Shell function `calculate_max_pens() {` to solve the following problem: This function calculates the maximum number of pens that can be bought with a given amount of money.
 The price of one pen is 1 Yuan and 9 Jiao (1.9 Yuan). 
 The function takes two integers, a and b, as input where 'a' represents the Yuan and 'b' represents the Jiao part of the total money available.
 It returns the maximum number of pens that can be purchased.
 For example, if a=5 and b=0, the function will return 2, as the total money is 5 Yuan, and two pens cost 3.8 Yuan.
